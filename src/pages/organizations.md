            content: >-
                We ask all our clients to donate to charity on behalf of the services we provided. A charity is mutually chosen before the signing of a contract. If you don't have one in mind, we are happy to you refer established charities across North America!

                Once the contract has been signed, we meet on a weekly/biweekly basis to update you on the status of the project. Our process starts with designing, then implementation and finally documentation and maintenance. Throughout this process, you as the client will have the opportunity to provide input and feedback on the project.

          - header: How does SFL prove they have donated to charities?
            content: >-
                Software For Love does **not** donate to charities. We actually ask the client to directly donate to the charity and send us the receipts of their donations. This way our clients get the pleasure and satisfaction when they themselves donate to charity, as well as get tax benefits because of their donations.
          - header: How often do project updates occur?
            content: >-
                Based on your preference, we try to meet as much as possible. Usually this is weekly or bi-weekly based on your availability. We believe in an iterative design and development process where at each step your input is valued.
