## Client

The Carpal Tunnel Solutions team at uBionics at the University of Ottawa, are a student run team that is developing a wrist guard for those with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). Their goal currently is to create a product that can be entered into clinical trials.

## Problem

The client required a website to effectively showcase what their team does, who they are, and relevant projects, in an organised manner. The client needs a website that they need to submit to an ethics committee.

The team successfully completed an organized site that fulfilled all of the clients requirements. The team page shows the team members in a well organised manner. A well designed navigation bar makes it easy for the user to shuffle between each page. A well functioning contact page makes it easier for users to comfortably reach out to the client’s team. The client can now use the site to promote their work. Furthermore, the site effectively displays four pages: Home Page, Solutions Page, Teams Page, and Contact Page.

## How is SFL involved?

SFL dedicated a team of four developers and a project manager to create an ideal website for the carpal tunnel solutions team at uBionics in uOttawa. SFL designed a responsive layout with four unique pages displaying a welcome message, past and current solutions that the carpal team has implemented, the members of the uBionics team at uOttawa, and a contact us page to get interested people to apply to the team. The site was created using React.js and hosted on Netlify. Interactive elements like slideshows and videos were implemented using sophisticated node packages, while general layout schemes and member cards were implemented using HTML and CSS. SFL suggested the use of Netlify to host the completed website. This helped to fully integrate form submission, by giving the opportunity to view and manage forms directly on one’s Netlify account. In addition, Netlify provides spam detection and the power to build and deploy websites with the press of a few buttons. Overall, SFL was able to provide a completed and hosted website within a span of only 2 months, while ensuring that all client needs were met.

## Development of Project

The site was developed under a tight deadline thanks to the commitment of the team. Each week the developers would meet twice and would meet once a week with the client to ensure constant communication and feedback throughout the project. As a result of the meetings, development could be done in an agile manner. As goals were set, they were implemented on a regular basis. Further, due to the client’s feedback, changes could be made alongside development preventing any major surprises or requests for changes at the end of the development cycle. It also ensured that the project satisfied the client’s demands. Once the client was completely satisfied with the project we began to execute the deployment of the site. The site was deployed using Netlify alongside the client, and handed over at completion.
